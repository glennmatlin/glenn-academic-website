## LLM Evaluation Framework: Testing and Benchmarking Language Models

This project introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks and domains. As LLMs continue to evolve rapidly, robust evaluation methods are crucial for understanding their capabilities, limitations, and potential risks.

### Project Overview

The LLM Evaluation Framework provides:

1. **Multi-dimensional assessment** across:
   - Reasoning and problem-solving
   - Knowledge retrieval and factuality
   - Safety and adherence to instructions
   - Robustness to adversarial inputs
   - Domain-specific performance

2. **Standardized methodology** for:
   - Creating consistent evaluation scenarios
   - Establishing clear metrics for comparison
   - Controlling for evaluation biases
   - Ensuring reproducible results

3. **Modular architecture** supporting:
   - Extensibility to new models and tasks
   - Customization for specific research questions
   - Integration with existing benchmarking tools
   - Automated evaluation pipelines

### Key Components

#### Task Suites

The framework includes specialized task suites for comprehensive evaluation:

- **Reasoning Suite**: Multi-step problems requiring logical deduction, mathematical reasoning, and causal inference
- **Knowledge Suite**: Factual recall across domains including science, history, current events, and specialized fields
- **Instruction Suite**: Evaluation of model's ability to follow complex, nuanced, or potentially conflicting instructions
- **Robustness Suite**: Tests for maintaining performance under input perturbations, context length variations, and adversarial prompts
- **Domain Suite**: Specialized assessments for performance in finance, healthcare, legal, and technical domains

#### Evaluation Metrics

The framework implements a range of metrics beyond simple accuracy:

- **Calibration Score**: Measures alignment between model confidence and correctness
- **Consistency Index**: Evaluates reliability of responses across similar queries
- **Error Analysis**: Categorizes and quantifies different types of model failures
- **Bias Detection**: Identifies systematic patterns of errors across demographic or topical dimensions
- **Hallucination Rate**: Measures frequency and severity of factual inaccuracies

### Research Applications

This evaluation framework supports ongoing research in:

1. **Model development** - Identifying weaknesses to guide architecture improvements
2. **Fine-tuning optimization** - Benchmarking different approaches to model adaptation
3. **Prompt engineering** - Testing effectiveness of different prompting strategies
4. **Safety research** - Assessing vulnerabilities to misuse and harmful outputs
5. **Domain adaptation** - Measuring performance gaps in specialized fields

### Current Status

The framework is currently in active development, with initial benchmarks established for several popular open-source and commercial LLMs. Ongoing work focuses on expanding the evaluation suites, improving methodology for human evaluation integration, and developing standardized reporting formats.
