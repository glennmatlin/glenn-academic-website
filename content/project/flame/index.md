## FLAME: Financial Language Model Evaluation Framework

The FLAME project is a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed to assess large language models (LLMs) in financial contexts. As LLMs continue to gain adoption in financial services, there is an increasing need for specialized benchmarks that can measure their capabilities and limitations within this domain.

### Project Goals

1. **Domain-Specific Benchmarking**: Create a benchmark suite that specifically targets financial knowledge, reasoning, and compliance capabilities.

2. **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: Assess models across various financial sub-domains including:
   - Banking regulations and compliance
   - Investment analysis and portfolio management
   - Financial reporting and accounting standards
   - Risk assessment and management
   - Market analysis and economic forecasting

3. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate model performance under various scenarios, including adversarial examples designed to test their reliability in high-stakes financial decisions.

4. **Leaderboard Development**: Maintain a public leaderboard tracking performance of popular LLMs on financial tasks.

### Methodology

The FLAME evaluation suite consists of:

1. **Knowledge Tests**: Assess factual knowledge about financial concepts, regulations, and historical market events.

2. **Reasoning Tests**: Evaluate the model's ability to perform financial calculations, analyze market trends, and make sound investment recommendations.

3. **Compliance Tests**: Measure the model's understanding of financial regulations and ability to identify potential compliance issues.

4. **Ethical Tests**: Assess how models handle ethically complex financial scenarios and whether they promote responsible financial practices.

### Current Status

The project is currently in development phase, with the initial benchmark suite being created and validated by financial domain experts. We are actively seeking collaboration with financial institutions and research organizations interested in contributing to this important evaluation framework.
